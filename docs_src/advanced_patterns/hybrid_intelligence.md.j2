# SOE Advanced Patterns: Hybrid Intelligence

## Introduction

The power of SOE comes from mixing **deterministic code** with **probabilistic AI**. Routers are 100% reliable. LLMs are creative. Combine them for systems that are both flexible and safe.

This is the "Centaur" model — human-like intelligence bounded by machine precision.

### Why Hybrid Intelligence Matters

Hybrid patterns are one of SOE's biggest selling points:

1. **Low-Latency User Endpoints**: Fast, deterministic routers handle user requests immediately
2. **Async AI Processing**: LLM-driven workflows run in the background for complex analysis
3. **Self-Evolving Context**: Deterministic workflows can be enhanced by AI that modifies context

This enables architectures where:
- Users get instant responses from deterministic logic
- AI enriches/improves the system asynchronously
- Complex decisions combine both in a single workflow

## Pattern 1: Safety Rails

Validate inputs and outputs around AI processing.

### The Workflow

```yaml
{{ extract_yaml('tests/test_cases/workflows/advanced_hybrid.py', 'deterministic_hybrid') }}
```

### How It Works

1. **ValidateInput** (Router) — Checks input meets requirements
2. **ProcessInput** (Tool/LLM) — Does the actual work
3. **ValidateOutput** (Router) — Ensures output meets requirements
4. **HandleError** (Router) — Catches any failures

**The AI never runs with bad input. The AI output never escapes validation.**

### The Flow

```
START
  ├─ INPUT_VALID ──→ ProcessInput ──→ PROCESSED
  │                                      ├─ OUTPUT_VALID ──→ DONE
  │                                      └─ OUTPUT_INVALID ──→ ERROR
  └─ INPUT_INVALID ──→ ERROR
```

## Pattern 2: LLM with Safety Rails

Same pattern but with an LLM doing the processing.

### The Workflow

```yaml
{{ extract_yaml('tests/test_cases/workflows/advanced_hybrid.py', 'hybrid_safety_rails') }}
```

### How It Works

1. Router validates `amount > 0` (deterministic)
2. LLM generates professional message (creative)
3. Router validates output length < 500 (deterministic)

**Enterprise use case**: Financial messages that must be professional but also compliant.

## Pattern 3: Retry with Validation

LLM generates output, router validates, retry if invalid.

### The Workflow

```yaml
{{ extract_yaml('tests/test_cases/workflows/advanced_hybrid.py', 'retry_pattern') }}
```

### How It Works

1. LLM generates JSON
2. Router checks if output is valid mapping
3. If invalid, increment retry counter and loop back
4. If max retries exceeded, emit `MAX_RETRIES`

**Key Insight**: The retry logic is deterministic. Only the generation is probabilistic. You control the boundaries.

## Why Hybrid Matters

| Pure LLM | Pure Code | Hybrid (SOE) |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Creative but unreliable | Reliable but rigid | Creative AND reliable |
| "Hope it follows rules" | "Can't adapt" | "Enforce rules, allow creativity" |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Validate early** — Check inputs before any AI processing
2. **Validate late** — Check outputs before any downstream effects
3. **Bound retries** — Never let loops run forever
4. **Log everything** — Use telemetry backend to track decisions
